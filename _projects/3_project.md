It has been demonstrated that large-scale display facilities can improve human cognition and promote collaboration among multiple users sharing the space. However, despite these benefits, such facilities can also pose challenges when multiple users wish to individually analyze the virtual content displayed on the shared screen. Modifying the representation on the shared display impacts all viewers in the facility simultaneously, limiting both individual and collaborative analysis and potentially compromising user privacy.

Therefore, this project investigates the integration of handheld devices within Large-Wall Display facilities, providing users with an auxiliary personal interface for individual exploration of the virtual environment.
