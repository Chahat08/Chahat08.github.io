Hello, World!

I'm an MS student in Computer Science at [Stony Brook University (SBU)](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), research assistant at the [Center for Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT)](https://www.cewit.org/), and a member of the [Center for Visual Computing (CVC)](https://cvc.cs.stonybrook.edu/). I received my BE in Computer Science and Engineering from [Panjab University, India](https://puchd.ac.in/) in 2023. 

Advised by [Arie Kaufman](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~ari/) at SBU, my research primarily focuses on visualization techniques for Large Wall Displays (LWDs), such as [Silo](https://vislab.cs.stonybrook.edu/facilities), [FlexiCAVE](), and, [Reality Deck](https://vislab.cs.stonybrook.edu/facilities). At CEWIT, my research has primarily centered on UAV image segmentation.  My interests include biomedical and information visualization, immersive and situated visualization techniques, and interactions in AR/VR.
